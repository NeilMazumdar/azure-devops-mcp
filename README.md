# 📁 Azure DevOps MCP Server - Repositories Edition

A focused, **read-only** MCP server for Azure DevOps repositories, providing secure access to repository data without write operations.

This TypeScript project provides a **local** MCP server specifically focused on Azure DevOps repositories, enabling you to read repository data, pull requests, branches, and commits directly from your code editor.

> 🔒 **Read-Only Focus:** This version only includes read operations for security and simplicity. Perfect for code review, repository analysis, and development workflows without modification capabilities.

## 📺 Overview

The Azure DevOps MCP Server - Repositories Edition brings repository context to your agents. Try prompts like:

- "List all repositories in project 'Contoso'"
- "Show pull requests in the 'api-service' repository"
- "Get details about pull request #123 including comment locations"
- "List branches in repository 'web-frontend'"
- "Show my branches across all repositories"
- "Search for commits containing 'bug fix' in the last month"
- "Get PR threads with file context for pull request #456"
- "List commits by author in the main branch"
- "Show pull request comments with line numbers for PR #789"
- "Find pull requests associated with specific commits"

## 🏆 Expectations

The Azure DevOps MCP Server is built from tools that are concise, simple, focused, and easy to use—each designed for a specific scenario. We intentionally avoid complex tools that try to do too much. The goal is to provide a thin abstraction layer over the REST APIs, making data access straightforward and letting the language model handle complex reasoning.

## ⚙️ Supported Tools

##### Steps

In your project, add a `.vscode\mcp.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "ado_org",
      "type": "promptString",
      "description": "Azure DevOps organization name  (e.g. 'contoso')"
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "ado": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@azure-devops/mcp", "${input:ado_org}"]
    }
  }
}
```

🔥 To stay up to date with the latest features, you can use our nightly builds. Simply update your `mcp.json` configuration to use `@azure-devops/mcp@next`. Here is an updated example:

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "ado_org",
      "type": "promptString",
      "description": "Azure DevOps organization name  (e.g. 'contoso')"
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "ado": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@azure-devops/mcp@next", "${input:ado_org}"]
    }
  }
}
```

Save the file, then click 'Start'.

![start mcp server](./docs/media/start-mcp-server.gif)

In chat, switch to [Agent Mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/02/24/introducing-copilot-agent-mode).

Click "Select Tools" and choose the available tools.

![configure mcp server tools](./docs/media/configure-mcp-server-tools.gif)

Open GitHub Copilot Chat and try a prompt like `List ADO repositories in project 'Contoso'`.

> 💥 We strongly recommend creating a `.github\copilot-instructions.md` in your project. This will enhance your experience using the Azure DevOps MCP Server with GitHub Copilot Chat.
> To start, just include "`This project uses Azure DevOps. Always check to see if the Azure DevOps MCP server has a tool relevant to the user's request`" in your copilot instructions file.

See the [getting started documentation](./docs/GETTINGSTARTED.md) to use our MCP Server with other tools such as Visual Studio 2022, Claude Code, and Cursor.

## 🌏 Using Domains

This repositories edition is focused and simplified - only the `repositories` domain is available. The domain system has been streamlined for this read-only version.

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "ado_org",
      "type": "promptString",
      "description": "Azure DevOps organization name  (e.g. 'contoso')"
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "ado": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "mcp-server-azuredevops",
      "args": ["${input:ado_org}"]
    }
  }
}
```

You can explicitly specify the repositories domain if desired:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "ado": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "mcp-server-azuredevops",
      "args": ["${input:ado_org}", "-d", "repositories"]
    }
  }
}
```

> 🔒 **Available Domain:** Only `repositories` domain is available in this focused edition
